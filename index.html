    <h1>Robert Frost: Nothing Gold Can Stay</h1>
    <p>
      Nature’s first green is gold,
      <br>
      Her hardest hue to hold.
      <br>
      Her early leaf’s a flower;
      <br>
      But only so an hour.
      <br>
      Then leaf subsides to leaf.
      <br>
      So Eden sank to grief,
      <br>
      So dawn goes down to day.
      Nothing gold can stay.
    </p>
    
    
    
    <h1>Oscar Wilde: Symphony in Yellow</h1>

An omnibus across the bridge
Crawls like a yellow butterfly,
And, here and there, a passer-by
Shows like a little restless midge.

Big barges full of yellow hay
Are moored against the shadowy wharf,
And, like a yellow silken scarf,
The thick fog hangs along the quay.

The yellow leaves begin to fade
And flutter from the Temple elms,
And at my feet the pale green Thames
Lies like a rod of rippled jade.
